<hr size="2" width="100%" /><a name="alternative"></a><b>Modern
alternatives for Nombas products:</b><br />
<p>If you're in need of embeddable script engines here's some
good
options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>If it must be embeddable and ecmascript-compliant consider
the free and open-source <strike>engines from Adobe (they call
it ActionScript but it's really EcmaScript) or the Mozilla engines. They</strike>
V8 engine from Google. It may not be as wonderfullly amazingly great as
the Nombas engine (what could ever be) but will do in a pinch.</li>
<li>If you need a pure-Java ecmascript engine... um... I'm not
sure. I think mozilla maintains one as "rhino".</li>
<li>If
you want the smallest size and high performance, consider lua. lua is
very close to matching the original Cmm language Nombas produced.</li>
</ul>
If you were a user of CEnvi or ScriptEase Desktop:
<ul>
<li>For automating computer tasks involving interacting with
other
programs, Windows users have Windows Scripting Host, Macintosh users
have AppleScript, and xnix users have a number of shell languages. I
don't know that any push the abilities to manipulate the system quite
as much as CEnvi/SE:Desk did, but they're still very powerful and there
are a lot of developers and libraries to help out.</li>
<li>Python exists on most systems, and certainly has all the
power, and way way more libraries than CEnvi/SE:Desk ever did.</li>
<li>The two features CEnvi/SE:Desk had that I wish were in the
above options are:<br />
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>ability to create standalone executables, independent of
any other engine downloads</li>
<li>ability
to call *any* DLL or shared library directly from the script language,
so that extension of any complexity may be made in the language itself</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were a user of ScriptEase WebServer Edition:</p>
<ul>
<li>So
you're the guy who bought SE:WSE, huh? I've always wanted to meet you.
You'll be glad to know that server-side Javascript is making a big
comeback with node.js and a bunch of related extensions.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you were a user of Nombas distributed internet scripting
(SE:DS):</p>
<ul>
<li>For plain transmission of data between two systems, in a
way easier to implement than XML, <a href="http://json.org">JSON</a>
is the way to go.</li>
<li>For
use within web, interacting in semi-realtime, AJAX is all the rage now.
Every javascript framework makes AJAX really easy for you.</li>
<li>For the really fun stuff that SE:DS made easy, such as
moving logic around between machines as-needed, look at <a href="https://github.com/substack/dnode#readme">dnode
"freestyle r.p.c."</a>.
I haven't tried it yet myself, but from the documentation it looks to
be excellently conceived and appears to match the SE:DS philosophy and
patterns very closely. The only SE:DS concept I don't see in dnode is
the security pattern, wherein remote calls can apply a level of
security to exactly what parts of calls can be handled and what cannot
(i.e. in dnode is there a way to prevent callers from making
particularly dangerous calls, or do they have access to everything?).
The SE:DS idea that "the same code runs on the client and the server,
and can be written on one and automatically executed on the other"
seems to be pervasive in the new <a href="http://meteor.com/">meteorjs</a> "new way to build apps"--that's worth keeping an eye on.&nbsp;Yahoo's <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/cocktails/" target="_blank">Cocktails</a> &amp; <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/cocktails/mojito/" target="_blank">Mojito</a> also seem to be going this direction.</li>
