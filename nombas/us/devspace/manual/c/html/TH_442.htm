<p class=heading-4>Object type</p>
<p class=senormalpara>An object is a compound data type, consisting of one or more pieces of data of any type which are grouped together in an object. Data that are part of an object are called properties of the object. The Object data type is similar to the structure data type in C and in previous versions of ScriptEase. The object data type also allows functions, called methods, to be used as object properties. Indeed, in ScriptEase, functions are considered to be like variables. But for practical programming, think of objects as having methods, which are functions, and properties, which are variables and constants.</p>
