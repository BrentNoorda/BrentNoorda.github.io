Program: CEnvi version 2.11 for Windows

Short description:
          CEnvi for Windows is is a shareware C interpreter that doubles
          as a Windows batch language.  CEnvi makes C as easy to use as a
          batch language, but with much more power.

Long description:
          Cmm (C minus minus) is 'C' for the rest of us.  CEnvi runs Cmm
          programs in the DOS, Windows, OS/2, NT, etc... environments.
          Together, CEnvi and Cmm make the power and flexibility of the C
          programming language part of every computer user's environment,
          without the hardware, time, and programmer resources needed for
          developing full-blown C programs.

          With CEnvi and Cmm, anyone can take control of their computer
          environment.  C is not just for programming nerds anymore.  CEnvi
          utilites, macros, batch files, and scripts can quickly be
          created, shared, and modified among all computer users,
          professional and amateur alike.

          CEnvi can be incorporated at a pace that is comfortable to you:
          you may just want to use CEnvi code set up by a more experienced
          user, you may want to enhance existing batch files with a line or
          two of CEnvi code, or you may write complete utilities using
          CEnvi.

          150+ built-in functions, create your own, or call into Windows or
          other DLLs.  50+ sample files are included to demonstrate
          Cmm programming, DLL links, reading time, file read/write,
          controlling other programs, interacting with Windows and DOS,
          creating graphics and dialog windows, serial communications, menu
          and dialog creation or automation, and much more. $38. Also
          available for OS/2 and DOS.
