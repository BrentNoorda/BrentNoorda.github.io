Program Archive Name: CEnvi2.zip

Program: CEnvi version 2.11 for OS/2 2.x

Short description:
          CEnvi for OS/2 is a shareware C interpreter that doubles as a
          batch/REXX enhancer or replacement.  CEnvi makes C as easy to use
          as a batch language, but with much more power.

Long description:
          Cmm (C minus minus) is 'C' for the rest of us.  CEnvi runs Cmm
          programs in the DOS, Windows, OS/2, NT, etc... environments.
          Together, CEnvi and Cmm make the power and flexibility of the C
          programming language part of every computer user's environment,
          without the hardware, time, and programmer resources needed for
          developing full-blown C programs.

          With CEnvi and Cmm, anyone can take control of their computer
          environment.  C is not just for programming nerds anymore.  CEnvi
          utilites, macros, batch files, and scripts can quickly be
          created, shared, and modified among all computer users,
          professional and amateur alike.

          CEnvi can be incorporated at a pace that is comfortable to you:
          you may just want to use CEnvi code set up by a more experienced
          user, you may want to enhance existing batch files with a line or
          two of CEnvi code, or you may write complete utilities using
          CEnvi.

          nearly 100 samples are included, demonstrating such tasks as:
          looping in batch files, setting the NumLock key, killing processes,
          calling DLLs, deleting directory trees, opening desktop folders,
          scheduling task times and priorities, controlling PMSHELL and WPS,
          fine-tuning DOS sessions and appearances, sending keystrokes
          to PM and Windowed applications, menu selections, automating
          DOS, Windows, and OS/2 sessions, and much more...
