1.  CEnvi Unregistered Shareware

1.1.  Introduction to Cmm and CEnvi

          Cmm (C minus minus) is 'C' for the rest of us.  CEnvi runs Cmm
          programs in the DOS, Windows, OS/2, etc... environments.
          Together, CEnvi and Cmm make the power and flexibility of the C
          programming language part of every computer user's environment,
          without the hardware, time, and programmer resources needed for
          developing full-blown C programs.

          With CEnvi and Cmm, anyone can take control of their computer
          environment.  C is not just for programming nerds anymore.  CEnvi
          utilites, macros, batch files, and scripts can quickly be
          created, shared, and modified among all computer users,
          professional and amateur alike.

          CEnvi can be incorporated at a pace that is comfortable to you:
          you may only want to use CEnvi code set up by a more experienced
          user, you may want to enhance existing batch files with a line or
          two of CEnvi code, or you may write complete utilities using
          CEnvi.

1.2.  CEnvi unregistered shareware version

          This package is the unregistered shareware version of CEnvi.
          Nombas provides this unregistered shareware version of CEnvi so
          that you can try the program for a 30 days before deciding whether
          to buy.  If, after 30 Days of using using this product, you
          think CEnvi will be useful to you and/or your organization then
          use the registration form at the end of this document (or see the
          file: REGISTER.DOC) to register CEnvi.

1.2.1   Why you should register

          If you register, then you will receive:
            *The latest version of CEnvi for all supported platforms
              (currently DOS, OS/2, and Windows, with NT support expected
              soon) without the annoying "Please Register" reminder.
            *The CEnvi user's manual (almost 100 pages, including a
              description of the Cmm programming language, a tutorial for
              those who have never programmed, and descriptions and
              examples of the nearly 150 functions included in the CEnvi
              library).
            */BIND option for creating standalone executables from Cmm
              scripts for your own personal use.
            *Support from Nombas and CEnvi/Cmm users through
              CompuServe (72212,1622), internet (bsn@world.std.com), the
              cenvi-cmm e-mail mailing list (cenvi-cmm@world.std.com), and
              the Nombas BBS (617-391-6595).
            *Access to the growing list of CEnvi utilities and libraries
              (some of which are included in this unregistered shareware
              package, and others are contributed by Nombas and CEnvi/Cmm
              users to the electronic locations described above).
            *Discounts for additional registered version of CEnvi to use
              within your organization.

1.2.2   How to register

          See the REGISTER.DOC document that is included with this package
          (and is also duplicated at the end of this document), to purchase
          a registered version of CEnvi.

1.3.  Installing CEnvi, documents, and sample files

1.3.1   Installing CEnvi for DOS

          Create a directory to install CEnvi for DOS in(we recommend 
          CENVIDOS). UNZIP cenvidos.zip into the directory you created. CEnvi 
          for DOS includes two executables. CEnvid.exe is a regular DOS
          program. CEnvid32.exe is a 32 bit DOS version. It is useful if you
          find that the regular DOS version of CEnvi is running out of
          memory.
          
          The first time you run CEnvi for DOS, it will run the Cmm 
          installation script. The installation script does 2 things if you
          choose. It creates a CMMPATH environment variable pointing to the 
          directory you chose and adds the CEnvi path to the DOS PATH.
          

1.3.2   Installing CEnvi for Windows

          Create a directory to install CEnvi for Windows in(we recommend 
          CENVIWIN). UNZIP cenviwin.zip into the directory you created. CEnvi 
          for Windows includes two executables. CEnviw.exe is a Windows
          program that is both a Cmm interpreter and a Windows Command line
          and servewin.com allows windows to control DOS sessions.
                    
          The first time you run CEnvi for Windows from program manager, it
          will run the Cmm installation script. The installation script will
          set up CEnvi for Windows Properly. For Windows, install will add
          the CMMPATH profile value in WIN.INI (in the [CEnvi] section), and
          will also add the CMM file extension to the [Extensions] section
          in WIN.INI.It will create a CEnvi program group containing CEnvi
          for Windows, and a few sample Cmm utilities.
          
1.3.3   Installing CEnvi For OS/2

          Create a directory to install CEnvi for OS/2 in(we recommend 
          CENVIOS2). UNZIP cenvios2.zip into the directory you created. CEnvi 
          for OS/2 includes two executables. CEnvi2.exe is a OS/2 program.
          CEnvi2PM.exe is used by CEnvi2.exe to make presentation manager
          calls. It must be in the current directory or in the search 
          path for many of the Os/2 samples to work correctly.
                    
          The first time you run CEnvi for OS/2, it will run the Cmm 
          installation script. The installation script will set up CEnvi for
          OS/2 Properly. The installation script does 2 things if you
          choose. It creates a CMMPATH environment variable pointing to the 
          directory you chose and adds the CEnvi path to the DOS PATH.
                    
1.3.4   4DOS and 4OS2 users - .cmm executable extension

          4DOS and 4OS2 users can directly execute .cmm files by
          associating the .cmm file extension with your CEnvi executable.
          Assuming the CEnvi.exe is in the c:\CENVID directory, then a 4DOS
          user would want to add this line to AUTOEXEC.BAT:
              SET .cmm=C:\CENVID\CEnvi.exe

1.4.  Removing CEnvi unregistered shareware

          If, after testing CEnvi for a few weeks, you choose not to
          register this version of CEnvi, then you should remove the
          program from your computer.  (Also please consider telling Nombas
          why CEnvi did not suit your needs; we need such feedback if we
          are to improve the product.)

          For all operating systems, the first step for removing CEnvi is
          to delete all the CEnvi files and the directory that you copied
          the files to.  The next step depends on your operating system:

1.4.1   DOS de-installation

          Install.cmm made two changes to C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT: the directory
          that CEnvi was in will have been added to your PATH statement,
          and the CMMPATH environment variable will have been added.  To
          de-install CEnvi you must remove the CEnvi directory from the
          PATH statement and you must also delete the "SET CMMPATH=..."
          line.

1.4.2   OS/2 de-installation

          Install.cmm made two changes to C:\CONFIG.SYS: the directory that
          CEnvi was in will have been added to your PATH statement, and the
          CMMPATH environment variable will have been added.  To de-install
          CEnvi you must remove the CEnvi directory from the PATH statement
          and you must also delete the "SET CMMPATH=..." line.

1.4.3   Windows de-installation

          Install.cmm made two changes to WIN.INI: the CMM profile
          extension was added and the CMMPATH profile string was created.
          To de-install CEnvi you must edit WIN.INI (with NOTEPAD.EXE for
          example) and remove from the [Extensions] section a line similar
          to this:
               CMM=C:\CENVI\CENVI.EXE ^.CMM
          and also remove these line (or lines much like these) from
          WIN.INI:
               [CEnvi]
               CMMPATH=E:\NOMBAS\CENVI\EXAMPLES.WIN

1.5.  Using this package

1.5.1   Unregistered CEnvi shareware executable

          The executables in this package, are identical to
          the registered versions of CEnvi at the time this package was
          created with one exception: this unregistered shareware version
          will occasionally put up a screen to remind you to register your
          copy of CEnvi (see the bottom of this document or REGISTER.DOC).
          Nombas has spent, and will continue to spend, time and resources
          developing and supporting CEnvi and Cmm.  Without your honest
          support Nombas cannot improve and support CEnvi (and pay
          mortgage, feed the kids, pay the doctor, etc...).

          It is likely that months have elapsed since this shareware
          package has been put together (see date at the top of this file).
          If so, then the version of CEnvi you receive will be an updated
          version of this one.  At the time of this release, incremental
          improvements have been planned in memory use, speed of execution,
          debugging tools, developer tools, and documentation.

1.5.2   Example programs

          The following example programs are included with this shareware
          version of CEnvi.  Those files with a batch extension (.BAT for
          DOS and .CMD for OS/2) can be run by invoking the batch file
          directly.  Those files with the CEnvi source file extension
          (.CMM) are invoked by executing CEnvi with the file name as the
          first argument (e.g. CENVI FranTick.cmm).  Files with different
          (e.g., *.LIB, *.H, *.DAT) are files used by CEnvi some of the
          example programs.

          Many of the files will provide help for how to use them if they
          are invoked with "/?" as the only parameter.

          All of these example files are here for you to view, study,
          experiment with, and alter for your own use.  The Nombas BBS will
          continue to gather CEnvi and Cmm example files created by Nombas
          or uploaded by CEnvi and Cmm users; so registered users will have
          a large library to choose from (maybe some other CEnvi user has
          already solved your need, or perhaps their need is close to yours
          and you will only have to make small modifications to someone
          else's uploaded CEnvi program).

1.6.  CEnvi - A Cmm Interpreter

          This section describes the CEnvi program, and describes the
          various methods for use CEnvi.exe to execute Cmm programs.

1.6.1   What is CEnvi?

          CEnvi is the first application to implement the Cmm programming
          language.  CEnvi is a Command-line version of a Cmm interpreter,
          and it can use Environment variables as if they were global Cmm
          variables.  CEnvi contains a reasonable facsimile of the standard
          C library, and can link at runtime to external Cmm libraries.

          The "Envi" and the "C" in CEnvi reflects the envy that computer
          professionals often feel when they are working on a computer that
          does not have a complete C programming environment.  "Envi" also
          refers to the environment variables that CEnvi attempts to work
          with as if they were regular Cmm variables.

          Like all implementations for Cmm, CEnvi is portable between
          operating systems.  It is currently testing under DOS, OS/2, and
          Windows, and other OS ports are in the works. NT and Presentation
          manager are currently available in beta form.

1.6.2   Environment Variables

          Variables in all UPPERCASE letters are taken from the environment
          variables.  Environment variables are treated like other
          variables except that they don't need quotes around them to
          default to being strings if they don't match another type.

          In the source code, the only difference between a variable and an
          environment variable is that environment variables are all
          UPPER_CASE letters.  When an environment variable is first used,
          it is read from the environment block and some assumptions are
          made about what kind of variable it is; this can lead to problems.
          When I=666 is interpreted as the number 666 when really it maybe
          should have been the string "666".  Before the program exits, all
          environment variables used by the code are then written to the
          environment block.

          In some implementations (CEnvi for DOS, for example) the
          environment variables remain changed even after the Cmm
          interpreter exits.  In other cases, special kludges must be added
          to alter a parent process' environment variables (see ESet() for
          OS/2).

1.6.3   Special Environment Variables

          These environment variables affect where CEnvi looks for source
          files:
            *CMMPATH: This environment will be checked for directories to
              search for include files if the include file is not in the
              current directory.  For Windows, this value may come from the
              CMMPATH profile value in WIN.INI (in the [CEnvi] section).
            *PATH: Batch-file source files (see below) will be searched in
              these directories if not found in the current directory.
            *CENVI_ESET: In those environment for which CEnvi cannot
              covertly alter the environment variables of the command
              interpreter (e.g., OS/2), this environment variable specifies
              a file name.  CEnvi will write the strings necessary for the
              command interpreter to set environment variables as altered
              by your Cmm code.  See the description of ESet() for more
              information about this command.

1.6.4   Executing Code as command-line Input Parameters

          If a Cmm program is very short, then it can be executed wholly
          from the command line.  For example, here is the famous hello
          world program executed from the cli prompt:
              CEnvid main() { printf("Hello world!"); }
          which can be written more conisely under Cmm rules as:
              CEnvid printf("Hello world!")

          You may have to keep in mind bahavior of the cli when inputting
          code.  It is sometimes necessary to put quotes around code to
          keep symbols from being interpreted by the cli, as in this
          example:
              CEnvid "for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("%d\n",i)"
          where the quotes are necessary to prevent the cli from
          interpreting the "<" as file redirection.

          Also, in batch files (DOS, OS/2) you need to remember that "%"
          has special meaning for the batch file processor, so the
          above line in a batch would have to be written as:
              CEnvid "for(i=0;i<10;i++) printf("%%d\n",i)"

1.6.5   Executing *.CMM Source File Code

          A file with the extension ".CMM", if the file name is given as
          the first parameter to CEnvi.exe, is considered by CEnvi to be
          pure CMM source code.  This file with the .CMM extension is
          expected to be a plain Cmm source file, just as a C compiler
          expects a file with the .C extension to be C source code.  CEnvi
          will check the current directory for the .CMM file, and then
          check directories in the PATH environment variable.  Any
          arguments passed to CEnvi.exe after the .CMM source name are
          given to the main(argc,argv) function in the source, if there is
          one.  So the hellow.cmm program can look identical to the
          hellow.c program, and when you run CEnvi.exe hellow.cmm you get
          the same output.  If you run
              CEnvi.exe FOO.CMM One Two Three
          the main function in FOO.CMM would get argc=4 and
          argv[0]="FOO.CMM" and argv[3]="THREE".

          This means that if you were to have an executable FOO.EXE
          that is similar to FOO.CMM, then "FOO.EXE" is interchangeable
          with "CENVI FOO.CMM", i.e.,
              FOO.EXE arg1 arg2 arg3
          is the same as:
              CENVI FOO.CMM arg1 arg2 arg3

          In OS/2 or Windows or other environments where file extensions
          can be associated with programs, you may want to associate the
          .CMM extension with CEnvi.exe, so that double-clicking on
          HELLOW.CMM will act identically to double-clicking on the
          compiled-and-linked HELLOW.EXE. In any of the CEnvi shells,
          CEnvi scripts can be launched from the command line by simply
          typing in their name.

1.6.6   Running CEnvi from a Batch-File

          The most convenient method for executing Cmm source code from the
          DOS or OS/2 command line is to use a batch file. If the first
          argument to CEnvi is the name of a batch file, then CEnvi reads
          that batch file and accepts as source all the code between the
          lines "GOTO CENVI_EXIT" and ":CENVI_EXIT", and passes the command
          line arguments to main(argc,argv).  This is very similar to
          executing:
              CEnvi.exe #include'foo,bat,,GOTO CENVI_EXIT,:CENVI_EXIT'
          except that the '#include' statement is handled automatically by
          CEnvi, and the rest of the command-line arguments are passed to
          main().

          Note that ".bat" is the DOS version of the batch file name
          extension.  This name is different for different operating
          systems.

          In this way, a batch file can be run exactly like a .EXE file,
          and the command arguments are passed to main in the same way.  If
          the full path of the batch file is not supplied, then CENvi will
          look in the current directory and then in directories in the
          PATH.

          Here is an example of an OS/2 batch file that expects any number
          (up to 9) of integers and sets the SUM environment variable to
          the values added together.  (It calls CEnviSet instead of CEnvi
          directly in order to set the environment variable.)

              @echo off
              REM *********************************************************
              REM *** SUM.CMD - Use CEnvi to sum lots of numbers together,*
              REM ***           setting the SUM environment variable to   *
              REM ***           the result of adding all the numbers.     *
              REM *********************************************************
              call CEnviSet %0.cmd %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9
              GOTO CENVI_EXIT

              main(argc,argv)
              {
                SUM = 0;
                for ( i = 1; i < argc; i++ )
                SUM += atoi(argv[i])
              }

              :CENVI_EXIT

1.6.7   EXTPROC: *.CMD Source file (For OS/2)

          Under the OS/2 command processor, you can define an external
          processor to process a batch (*.cmd) file if the first statement
          is EXTPROC.  EXTPROC is followed by the name of the processor,
          which in this case will be "CEnvi".  This is an example file,
          ARGS.CMD, of a program to display all input parameters:

              EXTPROC CEnvi

              main(argc,argv)
              {
                for ( i = 0; i < argc; i++ )
                printf("Input argument %d = \%s\n",i,argv[i]);
              }

1.6.8   Running CEnvi from a REXX-File (For OS/2)

          Similar to the running CEnvi from a Batch-File described above, 
          if the first argument to CEnvi is the name of a REXX source file,
          then CEnvi automatically executes the code between 
          "SIGNAL CENVI_EXIT" and "CENVI_EXIT:".  This example Rexx file for
          OS/2 behaves the same as the previous batch program example
          (CEnviSet.cmd is an OS/2 batch file that helps run Cmm files if
          environment variables need to be altered--see ESet in the OS2Lib
          appendix):

              /***********************************************************
               *** SUM.CMD - Use CEnvi to sum lots of numbers together,***
               ***           setting the SUM environment variable to   ***
               ***           the result of adding all the numbers.     ***
               ***********************************************************/
              'call CEnviSet %0.cmd %1 %2 %3 %4 %5 %6 %7 %8 %9'
              SIGNAL CENVI_EXIT

              main(argc,argv)
              {
                SUM = 0;
                for ( i = 1; i < argc; i++ )
                SUM += atoi(argv[i])
              }

              CENVI_EXIT:

1.6.9   CMM File Association and Drag-and-Drop (OS/2)

          You can associate CEnvi.exe with .cmm files through the settings
          notebook of CEnvi.exe.  This lets you executed any CEnvi *.cmm
          file simply by double-clicking its icon in the desktop.

          A Cmm program can be set up as a Workplace Shell program that
          accepts drag and drop.  To do this, drag a program template out
          of the templates folder and place it on the desktop where you
          want your Cmm program to run from.  In program settings for this
          program object set the program name to the path and file
          specification for CEnvi.exe (e.g., "C:\CMM\CEnvi.exe").  Set
          Parameters to the full source and file name of the Cmm file
          (e.g., "C:\CMM\CZIP.cmm").  Then rename the program object to
          whatever you want (e.g., "CZIP").  Then whenever you drag a file
          onto that object then the filename will be the second argument to
          main().

1.6.10  CMM File Association and Drag-and-Drop (Windows)

          You can associate Cmm files with CEnvi.exe by using the File
          Manager: select a .cmm file then choose File/Association and
          select the full path to CEnvi.exe.  After this, you can run any
          of *.cmm program simply by double-clicking on it.

1.6.11  /BIND= Create Stand-Alone Cmm Executables

          The CEnvi /BIND option allows you to create stand-alone,
          royalty-free executables from your Cmm code.  The result of /BIND
          is a binary executable file that operates the same as if CEnvi
          were invoked as an interpreter, except that CEnvi.exe is not
          needed to execute the bound file, because CEnvi.exe and your Cmm
          code are bound together in the created executable.

          The following example creates an executable named HELLOW.EXE that
          would print "Hello world!".
              CEnvi /BIND=HELLOW printf("Hello world!");

          As another example, you could create a stand-alone editor, which
          we'll call CMMEDIT.EXE, from the result of the CEnvi tutorial
          with the following command:

              CEnvi /BIND=CMMEDIT.EXE CMMEDIT.CMM

          Now running "CMMEDIT.EXE C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT" from the command line
          would be identical to executing "CENVI.EXE CMMEDIT.CMM
          C:\AUTOEXEC.BAT".

1.6.12  /BIND for OS/2 and CEnvi2PM.EXE

          When you /BIND Cmm source code that contains calls to
          PMDynamicLink(), or other PMxxx() calls that invoke CEnvi2PM.exe,
          the resulting executable will still require CEnvi2PM.exe.  So
          users running the bound executable will still need CEnvi2PM.exe
          in a directory of their search path.  CEnvi2PM.exe may be
          distributed royalty-free.

1.6.13  /BIND for Windows

          The simplest method for using /BIND in Windows is to execute
          CEnvi.exe, and then to enter the /BIND statement and Cmm source
          name from the CEnvi command prompt.  For example, to turn
          WhoRYou.cmm into the stand-alone WhoRYou.exe, you would execute
          CEnvi.exe and then enter the following at the CEnvi "Code:"
          prompt:

              Code: /BIND=WhoRYou WhoRYou.cmm
