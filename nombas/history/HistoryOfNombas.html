At first I had no language tools, and programmed my                  6502 Atari with opcodes. Then there were the “standard”                  languages: Basic, Pascal, Fortran, Assembly (8086, 6502,                  PDP-11, 360, 68000, TMS320), SQL, C, C++. There were the batch                  languages: Batch, Bourne, Bash, Korn, C-Shell, Rexx. Then                  there were application-specific command languages that seemed                  to go along with every new program that was released.                  &nbsp;That was far too many languages for me. Being of limited                  intellect, I felt that each time I had to master a new                  language I would have to give up mastery of some old language.</span></p>              <p class="c5 c9"><span class="c14"></span></p>              <a href="#"                name="ffa950276d9ad5dca8a2184818136d12691e3df5"></a><a                href="#"                name="1"></a>              <table class="c8" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tbody>                  <tr class="c4">                    <td class="c18">                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <br>                    </td>                    <td class="c2">                      <p class="c10"><span>Editorial: This over-abundance of                          languages is still a problem today, in my opinion, and                          it’s a theme to which I’ll return.</span></p>                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <p class="c10"><span>Take, for a recent example, the                          current widespread use of templating languages in the                          web space. There are several server-side templating                          languages people apply to their HTML code, and then                          there are several server-side templating languages. So                          already there are two problems: 1) several templating                          languages to choose from (crazy), and 2) the HTML                          templating languages are different than the CSS                          templating languages (super-crazy). The issue is even                          worse because most web developers don’t yet realize                          that they can optimize their systems by delivering                          slightly different javascript code to their                          slightly-different clients, but when they realize it,                          guess what, they’ll probably create yet another                          server-side templating language just for JS files, and                          naturally it will resemble neither the HTML nor the                          CSS templating languages (crazy crazy crazy).</span></p>                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <p class="c10"><span>To make matters worse, every                          developer that wants to prove himself will at some                          point develop a new language. Is it just as capable of                          implementing a turing engine as all the other                          languages that already exist? Yes. Is it better than                          the existing language it’s meant to replace? Maybe. Is                          it so much better that the rest of us should throw out                          our expertise to learn the new language?

If you wanted to get serious work                  done, you used C. (Curiously, even most of those                  command-specific and batch languages I mentioned above were                  themselves implemented in C.)</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>Most importantly, C was where the good and                  high-paying jobs were, which is why people wanted to learn C                  and why they showed up for an adult-education class that I was                  teaching. The C language had a reputation for being difficult,                  and so I expected it to be difficult to teach. But as we                  stepped through the basic syntax elements it wasn’t hard at                  all, almost everyone was following right along very quickly.                  Until...</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>At one point the majority of the class, who                  until then was learning to program surprisingly quickly,                  stopped clicking with what I was teaching. Certain topics just                  left them completely confused: e.g., pointers (incrementing                  and dereferencing), sizes of datum and data, allocation and                  freeing, stack use... It took a while, but eventually I                  realized where the problem lay: For a large segment of the                  students, maybe most, any aspect of C that involved                  understanding how data was arranged in computer memory just                  led to total confusion. Maybe I was teaching it wrong? Maybe a                  fundamental a background in opcodes and assembly and even                  circuit boards is needed to really “get it”? Maybe it’s just                  an unnatural concept that doesn’t mesh with most humans                  brains? In any case, I started to think that most of these                  students were never going to be top-notch C programmers, at                  least not with me as the teacher.</span></p>              <p class="c5 c9"><span class="c14"></span></p>              <a href="#"                name="5d8b4231ddf6d272437ce2eb0caa7cc2ffd85636"></a><a                href="#"                name="2"></a>              <table class="c8" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tbody>                  <tr class="c4">                    <td class="c18">                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <br>                    </td>                    <td class="c2">                      <p class="c10"><span>Editorial: To this day I remain                          constantly surprised how many people in the software                          field don’t understand how memory works.

By that I mean that the                  idea gaining acceptance was that if one could correctly map a                  problem to an ideal representation in a data schema, then the                  solutions to that problem would flow from queries against that                  data.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>When a project came along a of time went into                  thinking how to describe the primary data schema, and the                  supporting data schema, and supporting schemas and temporary                  schemas to link the different schemas. With a brilliant data                  description, it was expected that any situation would be just                  an application of the database language tools (specific to the                  database tool, of course, until SQL toook over).</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>The result of this thinking was often a whole                  lot of interdependent tables and data, and special-case                  tables, to the level of complexity that hardly any real person                  could understand them.

During the course of that work, I                  began to feel that there was something wrong in being so                  data-centric... I began to feel that logic was important...

It would take a little while for me to                  understand the flaw in my brilliant plan, but fortunately I                  was sidetracked by a little side project...</span></p>              <h2 class="c11 c10"><a name="h.2wmyyonoe9c"></a><span>Working                  alone leads to more problems</span></h2>              <p class="c10"><span>Working on the “big idea” was the first time                  I’d been all on my own, and not in a larger group of                  developers and support staff. One of the first things I                  realized was how little I could do on my own compared to a                  bunch of people working together. Every little custom tool had                  to be written from scratch byme. I couldn’t afford to pay                  anybody, so what I needed was to become more productive as an                  individual. To make this productivity problem worse, there                  were a lot of operating systems vying for attention then (DOS,                  various Unixes, Macintosh, soon OS/2 and different versions of                  Windows) and my disk-caching software needed to run on all                  these systems. And so anything I could do that would work                  cross-platform would save me a ton of time.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>Finally, in what little work I did, I                  realized there were two levels of programming needed. The                  first level was the hard core and system stuff, that needed to                  optimally compress and transfer data, and interact with the                  operating systems. For this hardcore stuff the most important                  thing was that in run quickly, and it was worth a whole lot of                  effort to do so. But there was another level of programming,                  which would be the high level logic and configuration needed.                  For this level a control language would be needed, where the                  performance of the language itself wasn’t nearly as important                  as the need to write it, tweak it, experiment with it, and                  customize it quickly. And I wanted this control language to                  interact well with the underlying hardcore stuff. I looked                  around for such control languages, and they all took time to                  learn and evaluate, and none of them seemed well designed as a                  library to interact with my C code.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>I had a lot on my mind, it seemed like too                  many problems to solve.

On more thought I realized that memory size and                  layout meant starting with C, but removing type declarations                  and pointers. Without these two things I called it “C minus                  minus” (a play on the popular C++ language that adds to C),                  and experimented. In short, this meant that most C programs                  would run just fine as Cmm if you simply deleted the type                  declaration keywords, and any symbols involving memory (“*”                  and “&amp;” when refering to addresses, and replacing any                  “-&gt;” with “.”).

The reviews were almost always very good, we made a                  lot of must-have lists, and won a Shareware of the Year award                  from PC Magazine.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>But selling remained a struggle for the                  reasons we predicted: before getting to selling our product we                  had to first educate the potential customer on 1) the value of                  scripting over traditional languages, and 2) then we had to                  convince them that we had the right language and tools for the                  job. Our pitch for scripting in general was that it was a huge                  performance boost for any developer, but also brought in a                  level of control that greatly enhanced product customization                  and allowed that customization to be implemented by a lot more                  people with fewer skills. Our pitch that we had the right                  language and tools was that they were probably already using a                  C-based system language and by using Cmm and our tools their                  developers did not have to change their way of thinking                  between hard-core library versus customization code, and it                  became only a matter of deciding when it was more important                  that the code be high-performing (those first version of Cmm                  were not fast) or the developer be high-performing.</span></p>              <p class="c5 c9"><span class="c14"></span></p>              <a href="#"                name="83d9fbecc83fb8cb1c9b9443e462904038c7fb41"></a><a                href="#"                name="11"></a>              <table class="c8" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tbody>                  <tr class="c4">                    <td class="c18">                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <br>                    </td>                    <td class="c2">                      <p class="c10"><span>Editorial: That argument still                          resonates with me that Cmm made sense because it was                          nearly the same as C, and so didn’t require the                          developer to have to think too differently when moving                          between the system-level and the script-level                          languages.

Java was also a cross-platform, garbage-collected                  language, but much more complete in being its own environment                  rather than a language to embed into other programs. For a few                  years, just as things were looking easier, Java became a huge                  thorn in our side. The problem with Java was that Sun made so                  many promises about how it would cure every ill in IT, and Sun                  put so much money into marketing Java, that people started to                  believe the hype. So even as we were showing off great                  productivity gains from our script tools, we would commonly                  get feedback like “that’s great, but irrelevant, because                  pretty soon Java is going to do all that, and more, and much                  better.” Sometimes this meant we lost sales to people who were                  going to wait for Java, and sometimes customers made smaller                  commitments to use our tools as a stopgap until either Java                  became a little more or until they’d converted their entire                  system to Java--for a while we were even quietly licensing our                  ISDK to Sun for a project for which Java wasn’t quite ready.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>To counteract the Java threat I became a Java                  critic, complaining that it was too slow to be a good                  system-level language and too complex to be a good                  language-for-the-people, but mostly complaining that a                  programming language should be accepted on its own merits (of                  which Java had many), and not based on the amount of money                  that goes into marketing it. I argued that the most important                  area to conquer for productivity was not the particular                  language (nearly all programming languages are Turing-complete                  equivalents of each other), but how well they handled the many                  interfaces involved (between components, systems, and people).                  I argued that our tool was the best approach (of course) for                  such productivity.</span></p>              <p class="c5 c9"><span class="c14"></span></p>              <a href="#"                name="e08c7d0df329a973e14743c11a9f4bfdda35dec7"></a><a                href="#"                name="13"></a>              <table class="c8" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tbody>                  <tr class="c4">                    <td class="c18">                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <br>                    </td>                    <td class="c2">                      <p class="c10"><span>Editorial: My arguments against Java                          had validity, but mostly I was just being self-serving                          because I wanted people to accept our tools instead of                          Sun’s.

The World Wide Web                  had been invented, but hardly anyone knew that (I sure                  didn’t). The entire Nombas infrastructure consisted of a                  single PC running OS/2 and a BBS (so the world could dial in                  and retrieve sofware), which I also used for development of                  DOS, OS/2, &amp; Windows software, and for communicating with                  the outside world via CompuServe.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>With the founding and funding of Nombas, Inc.                  we could afford a real internet connection (via ISDN, and it                  cost a pretty penny) and real email and to set up a real FTP                  server to supplement the BBS. We were also able to start                  investigating this whole “World Wide Web” thing that everyone                  had been had been talking about.

The round-trip                  between a client and the server was pretty slow then, so we                  figured that embedding some logic directly into the client we                  could make a much better user experience. That hack                  demonstrated instant keyboard processing, client-side                  form-validation, image swapping to simulate animation, and a                  very trippy image-color manipulator. Sun was starting to talk                  a whole lot about their upcoming Java that would improve the                  web, and since we saw our technology as better suited we named                  these pages the “Espresso Pages”.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>We showed off these pages to everyone we                  could find working with the web, and since Netscape looked                  like it would be a big player we made a special effort to                  contact them to make sure they were aware of how a client-side                  script language could greatly enhance their product.

I mention Netscape, as opposed to all the other                          customers we failed to sell to, for a couple of                          reasons. First because, as I’ll describe in a moment,                          what Netscape soon did had a huge impact on our                          business. Second because I’m frequently asked if the                          stories are true that Netscape ripped off Nombas when                          they put LiveScript/JavaScript in their browser.</span></p>                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <p class="c10"><span>When I first saw the LiveScript                          specification and their representative use cases, just                          a few months after we’d presented our product to them,                          I was ticked off that Netscape had defined something                          similar to what we’d shown them instead of just                          licensing it from us. But Netscape’s language                          certainly wasn’t exactly the same as ours—similarities                          could very well be because any language created at                          that time would be a product of that time and the                          ideas in the air at that time. Brendan Eich, the                          person who did create JavaScript at Netscape, would                          later talk to me about the issue and he assured me                          that before creating JavaScript he’d never heard about                          Cmm nor the Espresso Pages, and I believe him.</span></p>                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <p class="c10"><span>Come to think of it, my memory is not                          clear on whether the Espresso Pages were created                          before our Netscape pitch, or were created soon                          thereafter to clarify by example why browsers needed                          embedded scripting. I do remember being resentful of                          Netscape in those early years, enough so that when                          they released an expensive toolkit for administrators                          to configure their browser, I released a version of                          the same thing (using a CEnvi bundle that hacked their                          browser) for free. </span><span class="c6">People in                          the software world lack maturity.</span></p>                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <p class="c10"><span>Funny thing: it turns out that there                          already was an even earlier web browser that included                          client-side scripting, ViolaWWW, and it demonstrated                          many of the same things our Netscape hack demonstrated                          (at least that’s </span><span class="c0"><a class="c3"                            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ViolaWWW">what                            Wikipedia says</a></span><span>, so it must be                          true).

We decided, of course, to switch to JavaScript but to                  do so transitionally, so that for a few versions our                  interpreters supported both Cmm and JavaScript (for most                  scripts they looked the same anyway) and eventually only                  JavaScript.

It meant losing control of our own language and instead                  following somebody else’s lead. Because Netscape was packaging                  their JavaScript engine as a standalone SDK product, it meant                  that for the first time we had direct competition for our most                  important product. Netscape’s first SDK version wasn’t very                  polished, but by the second time around they had a decent                  JavaScript product. They were charging more than we were                  (about four times, I recall) and so we had a little price                  advantage, and we had many years lead over them in many areas                  (performance, size, robustness, integration and debugging                  tools, integration experience, even independent developers who                  knew how to use our tools and so could consult), but since it                  was now Netscape’s language we were using there’s no doubt                  that Netscape was almost everyone’s first choice in exploring                  JavaScript integration. &nbsp;After plunking down $40K (est)                  for Netscape’s engine, companies were reluctant to want to try                  our JavaScript engines. That was all very bad for our                  business.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>But another funny thing happened, thanks to                  Netcape’s JavaScript becoming so popular so fast, what they                  did turned out to be very good for our business. Before this                  time, the toughest part of selling our product had always been                  1) teaching the value of scripting, and 2) convincing them                  that we had the right language. Because JavaScript was so                  popular (thanks, Netscape), these were quite suddenly                  non-issues. It wasn’t even such an issue for potential                  customers that Nombas might go belly up any day, because now                  there was an alternative supplier in Netscape.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>As always, sales increased (as always, not                  quite as much as our expenses as we explored other product                  areas), but we worried that fighting against the Netscape                  competitor (showing that we were better and cheaper) kept                  getting more difficult as their product matured closer to                  ours, and we worried we may be fighting a losing battled.                  Thinking “if you can’t beat ‘em join ‘em” We started working                  more closely with Netscape on APIs and Debugging interfaces,                  and giving them information to help with some acquisition                  talks they were having internally (said my source)…</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>And then one frightening day, at the start of                  1998, everything changed.

Our major                  competition, to whom we might very well have been losing the                  war, was no longer more expensive than us but instead was                  infinitely cheaper: free!

Our competition giving away their product                  was very very good for us. Before this time, most people                  wanting a JavaScript engine would go to Netscape first, pay                  them a decent chunk of money, and then we’d never have an                  opportunity. But now that Netscape’s was free, they could try                  out Netscape’s engine for free (instead of paying into it and                  so feeling locked in to having to use what they’d paid for)                  and if they weren’t happy with it, or just were curious, they                  could also try our product for free (our product was always                  free to try out). In a side-by-side comparison of features,                  performance, quality, and tools, the Nombas engine would                  almost always come out ahead (and we didn’t really cost a                  whole lot). For a smaller set of customers, using an                  open-source product made them queasy (even thought’s Netscape                  license was about as non-restrictive as possible), and so they                  went with our ISDK.

For instance, if you wanted                  to send data from computer A to computer B for processing, and                  get some data back, there had to be agreement about a lot of                  communication and data protocols. The mind-set of the day was                  still “transmitting information and computer processing speed                  are very expensive, so we must minimize the number of bits                  transmitted and the amount of CPU used.” The result was things                  like CORBA, and DCOM, and XDR, and lots of competing RPC                  protocols (things like XML-RPC and SOAP were on the horizon if                  kept up with Dave Winer and Scripting News). At Nombas we were                  supporting a lot of these things in our libraries (we tended                  to make pre-built script-accessible libraries for as much as                  possible, so our customers wouldn’t have to), but we were                  constantly struck by how gosh-darn complicated these protocols                  were. Not just complicated to write code for, but complicated                  to debug when they didn’t work: you’d have to see what was                  going over the wire, work a while to decode those bytes, then                  some engineer from Vendor A would get to arguing with some                  engineer from Vendor B about why their implementations of a                  complicated specification weren’t compatible.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span>It dawned on us that there was an easier way.                  Our script language was already, by its very nature, a way to                  represent complex data and algorithms in a way that was                  portable between systems, and independent of OS, endianness,                  or word size. Also, our emphasis in our script engine had                  always been to make it trivial to interoperate between                  compiled code and interpreted script, both ways. So, putting                  these issues together, here was the big a-ha: What if the data                  that went between machines was always script code (instead of                  any bitwise-defined protocol)? It sounds so simple, but what                  would result?</span></p>              <p class="c5 c9"><span class="c14"></span></p>              <a href="#"                name="cd53fbaa96f15783d7962f85b997617ea09cd8ea"></a><a                href="#"                name="20"></a>              <table class="c8" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">                <tbody>                  <tr class="c4">                    <td class="c18">                      <p class="c5"><span></span></p>                      <br>                    </td>                    <td class="c2">                      <p class="c10"><span>Editorial: Keeping things simple for                          humans eventually always wins.

We already had the basic code for interpreting scripts                  and interacting with compiled libraries. We added clever                  serialization code so that data and even functionality could                  be represented as script. We added clever code to let clients                  and servers interact seamlessly so it was very easy with just                  a few lines of code to make it just as easy to work with a                  remote machine as to work with local program (in fact,                  difference between “client” and “server” became                  indistinguishable as they both just became parts of the same                  computing system).

By having a very small slave                    running on each machine, IT could have the ability to do                    anything on those systems, such as: install new software,                    query for bugs and viruses, detect unused computers and turn                    them off, view the screens, simulate user interaction…                    anything, really. My favorite demonstration was showing                    automated installation of new versions of Office across all                    computers (Macs and PCs) automatically, overnight,                    controlled by one server script.</span></li>                <li class="c1 c13"><span>CycleTraders – In younger days of the                    web it was hard to know how well your web site was doing for                    people in other parts of the world (how quickly it loaded,                    if components were failing). CycleTraders allowed people to                    deploy watchers remotely in trade for being watched. The                    larger, overriding concept involved occasionally giving up                    processing time on your computer (especially when idle) in                    trade for others giving up their processing time, especially                    when it was more important to have a large number of remote                    computers instead of pure processing power, hence the name                    “CycleTraders”. (In the end, when Nombas was shutting down,                    the concept became “who wants to buy this domain name?” and                    a motorcycle dealer took it for a few hundred dollars.)</span></li>                <li class="c1 c13"><span>EmailTraders – As business were moving                    on to the internet, it was not uncommon to have email not                    work at all for a whole lot of reasons (dns, bad config, bad                    spam detection). The biggest problem with failed email                    systems was that if email wasn’t working, there was really                    know way to know about it other than to call the intended                    recipient and say “hey, did you get my email”.

One of our                  final customers is even now preparing their initial product                  launch, over nine years after we made the sale, and that’s                  pretty darn exciting.</span></p>              <h1 class="c10 c21"><a name="h.y0mc26htwtot"></a><span>A Letter to                  our 1992 selves: What we should have done different</span></h1>              <p class="c10"><span>When I get my time machine, I’m going to send                  this letter:</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Dear Nombas circa 1992:</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Hello, 1992.

A lot of people are going to                  become a lot more productive by using high-level languages                  like what you’re going to create. High-level script languages                  are going to overwhelm the software development world, even                  more than you’re so-far imagining.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">The most important way you might                  screw this up is by charging for the wrong things.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Your standalone CEnvi product is                  going to be great, and people paying money for it will excite                  you. That nickel and dime stuff (or $39 to $69 stuff) isn’t                  the money you want. That price or any price is a barrier to                  entry to getting people to use Cmm or (get used to this name)                  Javascript. Only a few people are going to realize the                  thousands of tools in that CEnvi box and will pay for it. What                  you want to do with CEnvi is to give it away to everyone, so                  that it’s free for them to use, so that they feel bad if they                  ever move to a system without, so that they’re addicted. Work                  with those who release ANY operating system and get your code                  into it (BTW, that thing called “linux” is going to be big:                  look into it.) Make sure every CS college student has access                  to CEnvi. Keep basic CEnvi free. It will catch on that way.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">If you want to be the de facto and                  cross-platform scripting and automation (and believe me you                  do), then DO NOT neglect the Macintosh operating system, or                  any operating system, with CEnvi. I know it seems like a lot                  of work just to make a very-portable tool across DOS, Windows,                  OS/2, and the *nixes, and your brains may seem fried if they                  have to also have to become Macintosh experts. But do it. The                  Macintosh thing is going to catch on, and if your CEnvi is a                  second-class player on that system then you will not achieve                  true default acceptance (i.e. you won’t be the lowest-common                  denominator tools available across all OSes), and the Mac                  people will have to wait years for a good command-line or                  automation tool, and Apple is going to have to eventually make                  something called AppleScript and it’s going to suck. You can                  prevent that by concentrating on Mac early.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Free, I repeat, free, is the right                  price for CEnvi. On day zero people don’t know how much this                  tool will enhance their lives, so they’re not willing to pay                  for it, so don’t ask them too. Give it away for free so it                  becomes an addictive drug. You can charge for a few things,                  such as the “pro” ability to make standalone executables, and                  for some of your own development and visual tools, and for                  working with vendors to add their own enhancements.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Most of what I say applies to the                  web server tool too.

Make it free                  for small projects, student projects, experimental projects,                  and non-commercial open source projects (that “open source”                  term will be coined soon and will become really popular). You                  will be able to charge for tools, many types of embedding,                  your expertise, and for large commercial products. When that                  happens, charge A LOT—remember that you’re not selling them a                  software library, you’re selling them a helluva lot more                  productive, and they NEED that.</span></p>              <p class="c5"><span class="c6"></span></p>              <p class="c10"><span class="c6">Avoid taking VC.
