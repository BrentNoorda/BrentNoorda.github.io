        <h1>Where, precisely, should I give $100,000 in 2016?</h1>
        <h3>an experiment in democratizing philanthropy</h3>
        <p><em>The following is an explanation of a question I asked on Quora <a href="https://www.quora.com/Where-precisely-should-I-give-away-100-000-in-2016-1">here</a>.</em></p>

        <p>My billionaire mother died in 2014. By 2015 I’d personally inherited about $3.2 million.
           Inheriting wealth goes against my conviction that we are all created equal, and so maintaining my peace of mind requires that I give the inheritance away.</p>
        <p>In 2015, my first year of giving, I gave away $100,000: 90% to tax-deductible non-profits and 10% to other causes and to cover giving expenses.
            Problem is, at $100K/year that $3.2M is going to keep growing forever (based on expected investment returns).
            To give it all away in a reasonable timeframe I figure I’ll need to work up to at least $300K/year.</p>
        <p>So in 2016, my second year of this task, I’ll be giving away $200,000.
           I can handle the first $100,000 myself (as I did in 2015) but I’d like the collective wisdom of the Quora community to tell me where to give the second $100,000.</p>
        <p><strong>Dear Quora Community: Where should I give away $100,000 in 2016?</strong>
           It can be to a non-profit, to a for-profit, to anything or anyone (whether tax-deductible or not).
           I don’t want to be answered with probing questions like “what do you think is important?” and I don’t want general answers like “research what has the most impact” or “you should read this book by so-and-so”.
           What I do want is specific answers, like “Give it to XXXXXX, because they will use it to… which is the best use of $100K because…”</p>
           <p style="margin-left:1.5em;">I want specific XXXXXX because I need to know who to write the check out to and where to send it (I don't want to put in a lot of effort, just money).</p>
           <p style="margin-left:1.5em;">You want good “because…” sections is to convince other users to Upvote your answer.</p>
        <p>By the end of November 2016, I’ll consider the collective wisdom of the Upvotes and give $100,000 as defined in the winning answer.</p>
        <p>Thanks for the help (especially to <a href="https://www.quora.com/I-need-to-give-away-1-million-USD-before-the-end-of-the-week-What-is-the-best-way-to-do-it/answer/Greg-Gordon-6">Greg Gordon</a> for suggesting this approach).</p>
