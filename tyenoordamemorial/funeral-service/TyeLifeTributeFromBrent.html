Life Tribute for Tye Noorda<br>

We Noorda children used to give THE BEST 2-1/2 minute talks. Our speeches were deep and insightful, thought provoking and funny. We would practice and practice until we had memorized not only every word, but also every nuance of delivery. We .. knew .. when .. to .. talk .. slow, we-knew-when-to-talk-fast, we&rsquo;d could masterfully wield the pregnant&hellip;. pause.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
We were so good that the other kids resented us for raising the bar too high.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
But that was then, when we had Mom, the master speechifier, to write our talks and coach us through our delivery. Now we Noorda children are on our own. Now, as I blunder my way through this speech, I realize that Mom&rsquo;s passing is not just a loss for me, but a loss for everyone within the sound of my voice.</span>
</p>

We all know Mom was an extremely talented dramatic artist. We might not all know that she honed her skills as a young girl, singing and dancing for the chickens she fed on her little family farm in Freedom, Utah.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Sometimes a chicken would be gone and she assumed it had run away. And sometimes her Dad came walking home from elsewhere with a dead chicken, already cleanly plucked for dinner. But it was a long time before she realized that those &ldquo;runaway&rdquo; chickens were the same ones her father was bringing home, and that she was eating her biggest fans.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
So that&rsquo;s how Mom achieved her first claim to fame: by becoming the first person in show biz to ever say of her audience, &ldquo;We were killen &lsquo;em out there.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">

I believe Mom was at her best when she was helping others to perform.</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_2-0 start">
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
Like when she was teaching her own children, and teaching her rock-star CEO husband, to give speeches.</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
Like when she wrote and taught songs for the Primary kids to belt out in church (never mind the fuddy-duddy bishopric who said &ldquo;Do Duddle&rdquo; was not reverent enough for the chapel)</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c0 c3">
Like when she wrote and directed a totally entertaining roadshow where dozens of young adults could act like dogs teaching good manners to humans.</span>

One of my favorites from this book is &ldquo;They&rsquo;ll Never Know.&rdquo; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s sung by a child with learning disabilities, who is not quite able to fit in.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2 c8">
<span class="c0">
But, who doesn&rsquo;t have learning disabilities? Who doesn&rsquo;t sometimes feel they don&rsquo;t fit in?</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Anyway, it goes like this:</span>
</p>
<p class="c5">
<span class="c0">
They&rsquo;ll never know what it&rsquo;s like to be me.</span>

<p class="c5">
<span class="c0">
They&rsquo;ll never know what it&rsquo;s like to be me.</span>
</p>
<p class="c5">

Hoping every day something good will come my way</span>
</p>
<p class="c2 c8">
<span class="c0">
so that everything will change for me and soon I will be</span>

<p class="c5">

going where the others go,</span>
</p>
<p class="c5">
<span class="c0">
knowing all the others know,</span>

<p class="c5">
<span class="c0">
seeing like the others see,</span>
</p>
<p class="c2 c8">
<span class="c0">
just being like the others be.</span>

They&rsquo;ll never know what it&rsquo;s like,</span>

That song is from Mom&rsquo;s musical play, &ldquo;Experience&rdquo;, which came together over 20 years from conception to first performance at the SCERA Showhouse. Even so, it&rsquo;s a work that </span>
<span class="c0 c12">
I</span>
<span class="c0">
&nbsp;don&rsquo;t think she completed until very, very recently.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
The play &ldquo;Experience&rdquo; deals with a spiritual theme at the root of Mom&rsquo;s testimony. Mom believed, and told us again and again, that our earthly life is for us to gather experience, to learn from experience, to overcome experience, and that God provides for us the experiences that each of us needs.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Mom went through many, many experience in her 90 years. Whether the experiences were good, bad, or perplexing, Mom relied on her faith, her endless hard work, her intelligence and creativity, and her amazing husband, to plow right through them.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
But more than a decade ago Dad&rsquo;s Alzheimer&rsquo;s was pretty severe. Then she lost her daughter. About eight years ago, Dad died. What a loss! For once, it seemed that some experiences might be too hard to handle. More recently, Mom has had to experience some serious mental and physical changes of her own.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Throughout this period, Mom continued to talk about Experience. &ldquo;Life is for Experience&rdquo; she would still say, but now it was often followed by a question: &ldquo;Why must I go through these experiences? Why these experiences?&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Well, Mom, I have a theory: In the past few years, along with the negative changes, there have been positive changes as well.</span>
</p>
<ul class="c13 lst-kix_list_3-0 start">
<li class="c5 c7">
<span class="c3 c0">
In the past few years you have started to dance, alone in your bedroom, as if no one is watching.</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
For exercise, you have lain on your slant-board, directing an invisible orchestra with your arms.</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
You have sat at the piano, endlessly playing &ldquo;Do Duddle&rdquo; and &ldquo;if things don&rsquo;t go your way today&rdquo;.</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
You, who were always a health food and fitness freak of the highest order, have been able to sit back on your recliner, watching Sound of Music, eating ice cream, and loving it.</span>
</li>
<li class="c7 c5">
<span class="c3 c0">
You have made crazy faces just for laughs, and put puzzles together, and modeled clay until your fingers cramped.</span>
</li>
<li class="c1">
<span class="c3 c0">
You have given your grown-up children a glimpse of that young girl, 80-plus years ago, performing in front of those chickens.</span>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Why did you start to do these playful things? Why did you, the woman who was always so productive, the woman who never ever took a vacation, who never splurged though she controlled a fortune, whose motto was put to music with the catchy song &ldquo;Work, Work, Work&rdquo;&hellip; Why did you start to dance and sing and play?</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c12 c0">
Because it was fun</span>
<span class="c0">
. You did these things because they were fun.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Mom, to answer your question &ldquo;why did I have to go through this last decade of experience?&rdquo; Because, Mom, you needed to learn to have good, pure, unadulterated fun, with no other purpose except for joy.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
I only realized this a few nights ago. Walking back from a taqueria, with no clue what to say today, I kept remembering the new phrase Mom had begun using in recent years. At the end of every phone conversation she had begun to say: &ldquo;Have fun while you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo; She said it to me a thousand times. &ldquo;Have fun while you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
And suddenly I understood. Experience had finally taught Mom the importance of FUN, and she had been trying to get it through my thick skull that I shouldn&rsquo;t wait as long as she had to figure this out.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
Having experienced and learned, and hopefully taught, that final lesson, I think Mom&rsquo;s time here was through, and so she left us.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2">
<span class="c0">
There are a lot of teachings for us in [</span>
<span class="c0 c6">
THIS COMPILATION</span>
<span class="c0">
] Mom left behind. But her final lesson never made it into this book, so I&rsquo;m telling you now. &ldquo;Have fun while you&rsquo;re young.&rdquo; Have fun while you&rsquo;re old. Have fun. Everybody, seriously: have fun.</span>
</p>
<p class="c14">
<span class="c0">
Love ya, Mom. Have fun.</span>
